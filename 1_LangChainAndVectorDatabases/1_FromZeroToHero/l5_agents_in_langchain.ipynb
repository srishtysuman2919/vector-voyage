    "    In LangChain, agents are high-level components that use language models (LLMs) to determine which actions to take and in what order. \n",
    "    An action can either be using a tool and observing its output or returning it to the user. \n",
    "    Tools are functions that perform specific duties, such as Google Search, database lookups, or Python REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Several types of agents are available in LangChain:\n",
    "    1. The zero-shot-react-description agent uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to employ based purely on the tool's description. \n",
    "        It necessitates a description of each tool.\n",
    "    2. The react-docstore agent engages with a docstore through the ReAct framework. It needs two tools: a Search tool and a Lookup tool. \n",
    "        The Search tool finds a document, and the Lookup tool searches for a term in the most recently discovered document.\n",
    "    3. The self-ask-with-search agent employs a single tool named Intermediate Answer, which is capable of looking up factual responses to queries. \n",
    "        It is identical to the original self-ask with the search paper, where a Google search API was provided as the tool.\n",
    "    4. The conversational-react-description agent is designed for conversational situations. \n",
    "        It uses the ReAct framework to select a tool and uses memory to remember past conversation interactions.\n",
    "'''\n",
