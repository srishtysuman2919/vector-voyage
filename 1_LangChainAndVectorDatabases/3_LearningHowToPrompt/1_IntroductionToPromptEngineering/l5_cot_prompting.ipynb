    "    Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT)-> encourage large language models to explain their reasoning process, leading to more accurate results. \n",

    "\n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    "    1. Can help break down complex tasks by assisting the LLM in decomposing a complex task into simpler steps, making it easier to understand and solve the problem. \n",
    "    2. Guide the model through related prompts, helping generate more coherent and contextually relevant outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Limitations:\n",
    "    1. Yield performance gains only when used with models of approximately 100 billion parameters or larger; \n",
    "        smaller models tend to produce illogical chains of thought, which can lead to worse accuracy than standard prompting. \n",
    "    2. May not be equally effective for all tasks; most effective for tasks involving arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning. \n",
    "        For other types of tasks, the benefits of using CoT might be less pronounced or even counterproductive."
