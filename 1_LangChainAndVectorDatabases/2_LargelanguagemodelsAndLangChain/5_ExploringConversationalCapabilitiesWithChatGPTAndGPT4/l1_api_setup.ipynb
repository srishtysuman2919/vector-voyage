    "    OpenAI's GPT-4 represents a significant advancement in the field of large language models. \n",
    "    Among its many improvements are enhanced creativity, the ability to process visual input, and an extended contextual understanding. \n",
    "    In the realm of conversational AI, both GPT-4 and ChatGPT use the Transformers architecture at their core and are fine-tuned to hold natural dialogue with a user. \n",
    "    While the free version of ChatGPT relies on GPT-3, the premium offering, ChatGPT Plus, gives access to the more advanced GPT-4 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The benefits of employing ChatGPT and GPT-4 in chat format are numerous. \n",
    "    For instance, GPT-4's short-term memory capacity of 64,000 words greatly surpasses GPT-3.5's 8,000-word limit, \n",
    "    enabling it to maintain context more effectively in prolonged conversations. \n",
    "    Furthermore, GPT-4 is highly multilingual, accurately handling up to 26 languages, and boasts improved steering capabilities, \n",
    "    allowing users to tailor responses with a custom \"personality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    The new model is considerably safer to use, boasting a 40% increase in factual responses and an 82% reduction in disallowed content responses. \n",
    "    It can also interpret images as a foundation for interaction. \n",
    "    While this functionality has not yet been incorporated into ChatGPT, its potential to revolutionize context-aware chat applications is immense.\n",
