'''
    In the LangChain library, the LLM context size, or the maximum number of tokens the model can process, is determined by the specific implementation of the LLM. 
    In the case of the OpenAI implementation in LangChain, the maximum number of tokens is defined by the underlying OpenAI model being used. 
    To find the maximum number of tokens for the OpenAI model, refer to the max_tokensCopy attribute provided on the OpenAI documentation or API. 

    For example, if youâ€™re using the GPT-3Copy model, the maximum number of tokens supported by the model is 2,049. 
    The max tokens for different models depend on the specific version and their variants. (e.g., davinciCopy, curieCopy, babbageCopy, or adaCopy) 
    Each version has different limitations, with higher versions typically supporting larger number of tokens.

    It is important to ensure that the input text does not exceed the maximum number of tokens supported by the model, 
    as this may result in truncation or errors during processing. To handle this, you can split the input text into smaller chunks and process them separately, 
    making sure that each chunk is within the allowed token limit. You can then combine the results as needed.

# Here's an example of how you might handle text that exceeds the maximum token limit for a given LLM in LangChain. 
 #Mind that the following code is partly pseudocode. It's not supposed to run, but it should give you the idea of how to handle texts longer than the maximum token limit.

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-003", openai_api_key="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")

# Define the input text
input_text = "your_long_input_text"

# Determine the maximum number of tokens from documentation
max_tokens = 4097

def split_text_into_chunks(input_text, max_tokens):
    return input_text

# Split the input text into chunks based on the max tokens
text_chunks = split_text_into_chunks(input_text, max_tokens)

print(text_chunks)
# Process each chunk separately
results = []
for chunk in text_chunks:
    result = llm(chunk)
    results.append(result)

def combine_results(results):
    return results[0]
# Combine the results as needed
final_result = combine_results(results)

# In this example, split_text_into_chunksCopy and combine_resultsCopy are custom functions that you would need to implement based on your specific requirements, 
# and we will cover them in later lessons. The key takeaway is to ensure that the input text does not exceed the maximum number of tokens supported by the model.
# Note that splitting into multiple chunks can hurt the coherence of the text.
